Key points include:\n\n1. **Carbon-Concentrating Mechanisms (CCMs)**: Cyanobacteria possess efficient CCMs, allowing them to thrive under low CO₂ conditions, which may give them a competitive advantage over other algae and plants. However, rising atmospheric CO₂ levels due to climate change could benefit species with inferior or no CCMs.\n\n2. **Nutrient Utilization**: Cyanobacteria are highly efficient at accessing low levels of inorganic phosphorus (P) and can utilize organic forms of nitrogen (N) and P, which are abundant in aquatic environments. This adaptability contributes to their dominance in nutrient-limited conditions.\n\n3. **Temperature and Blooms**: Higher temperatures promote cyanobacterial blooms, particularly in temperate and tropical ecosystems. In temperate regions, blooms often follow the decline of non-cyanobacterial phytoplankton, which deplete orthophosphate, a condition favorable for cyanobacteria.

            "Climate change has been cited as one of the factors contributing to the increase in cyanoHABs globall (Paerland Huisman, 2008; O'Neil et al., 2012; Paerl and Paul,2012; Yan et al., 2020) as well as within Florida (Paerl andHuisman, 2008; Havens and Paerl, 2015; Urquhart et al., 2017;Havens et al., 2019). Climate change influences cyanobacteria directly through temperature effects on metabolism as well as environmentally through impacts on the physical and chemical characteristics of the cyanoHABs environment. Cyanobacteria have a higher temperature optimum for growth than do eukaryotes (Paerl and Huisman, 2008), suggesting that they have a competitive advantage over other algae as temperatures increase.  A relationship between  water  temperature  and cyanobacterial dominance has been noted for many systems (deFigueiredo et al., 2006; Paerl et al., 2011). Carey et al. (2012)suggested that there are many other physiological advantages that favor cyanobacteria to effectively outcompete other algae under warming conditions, including buoyancy, P storage affinity, atmospheric N2 fixation and efficient light harvesting ability. The increases in rainfall and frequency of extreme rainfallevents predicted to result from climate change (Groisman et al.,2012) may also favor cyanobacteria through increased N and P nutrient loading to freshwaters, as well as changes in the quality and quantity of this loading, the volume ratio of inputs to receiving waters and its seasonal timing (Reichwaldt and Ghadouani, 2012). Additionally, increasing temperatures have a direct effect upon the physical characteristics of freshwater systems, resulting in earlier (Winder and Schindler, 2004) andstronger stratification and reducing vertical mixing (Xu et al.,2010) and longer residence times (Lehman et al., 2013; Cross et al., 2014). This may lead to potential oxygen depletion at depth and P enrichment from sediments, thus enhancing nutrient recycling (Sondergaard et al., 2003; Wilhelm and Adrian, 2008). The net effect of these climate change associated changes in freshwater systems, including those in Florida, is favoring of cyanobacteria over other algae.",

HABs are a serious threatto human health because of their toxic secondary metabolites. The ex-istence of HABs also deprives other aquatic organisms of a healthy living environment by monopolizing resources, often by secreting phytotoxic and biotoxic substances that inhibit the normal growth and reproduction of other species. In addition, cyanobacterial blooms produce toxicY. Zhang et al. The occurrence of HABs is environment-dependent, responding to nutrient accessibility, temperature and light availability in vulnerable freshwater systems. The ecological niche of HABs has increased withglobal climate change because the combination of warmer water tem-peratures, more UV radiation penetrating further into the water column,plus extra nutrient loading gives the HABs a competitive advantage overother aquatic organisms. HABs occur seasonally as these key environ-mental parameters fluctuate in freshwaters, which leads to the succes-sive occurrence of HABs and their toxins. The bloom-forming species engage in intra-and inter-competition for space and other resources. Intra-species competition is a strategy that allows algae populations toco-occur or out-compete similar species. Inter-species competition ex-plains why cyanobacterial blooms dominate in summer, whereas di-atoms and dinoflagellates are most numerous in the winter-spring period. In addition to the seasonal variation, the relative abundance of various species within HABs and their competitive interactions shows distinct patterns across the marine-to-freshwater continuum. These biological interactions account for ecophysiological acclimatation of HABs and their ability to grow in dynamic environmental conditions.",

Structural variations in reservoirs lead to differences in nutrient and light availability, affecting phytoplankton growth and adaptation. Areas with higher light availability are more prone to cyanobacteria blooms, while turbid, well-mixed areas have lower light and chlorophyll content. The transitional zone (mid-reservoir) typically has the highest primary production and should be a focus for management strategies. Down-river areas have greater depth, slower flow, and more light availability.\n\nLight is a key driver of growth during non-peak bloom months or deep mixing periods, while nutrient availability, particularly phosphorus, becomes critical during persistent stratification.

Excess fertilizer use, animal waste, atmospheric deposition, and municipal sewage are major sources of these nutrients. Climate change exacerbates the issue by increasing the frequency of high-magnitude storms and droughts, which can lead to nutrient pulses and HAB development. Warmer temperatures are predicted to enhance HAB formation and toxin release through increased growth rates and greater water column stability.

Raphidiopsis (cylindrospermopsis)Unlike the broader distribution of Dolichospermum and Aphanizome-non, Cylindrospermopsis (recently combined into the genus Raphidiopsis)has been considered a biological invasive species, because initially, it only appears in tropical areas around the world. Before the foundation of genus Cylindrospermopsis in 1972, Raphdiopsis has been reported as the component of cyanobacterial blooms in Chinese fish ponds and lakes(Jao 1952, Zhou 1987, Liu and Meng 1989). R. curvata, R. mediteriann,and R. sinensis were morphologically described. Taxonomic belonging of the genus Raphdiopsis at higher category was also discussed by Jao(1951), within Oscillatorlaes or Nostocales, but later molecular phylo-genetic evidence confirmed it as belonging to the latter. The introduc-tion of taxonomic knowledge for the genus Cylindrospermopsis was latein China. Four morphospecies in Cylindrospermopsis (C. african, C. cat-emaco, C. philippinensis, and C. raciborskii)have been characterized based on the strains isolated from Chinese waters (Li et al., 2016b). Increasing reviews of cylindrospermopsins (CYNs)in freshwater ecosystems haveraised the necessity for figuring out all potential CYN-generating cya-nobacterial species (Jiang et al., 2014). Raphidiopsis curvata HB1 isolated from a fish pond in Wuhan was first found to produce both CYN and deoxy-CYN in 2001 (Li et al., 2001). Polyphasic characterization of Raphidiopsis strains, phylogenetic examination on Cylindrospermopsis and Raphdiopsis, molecular elucidation for distinguishing the divergence between Cylindrospermopsis and Raphdiopsis, and CYN molecular biosynthesis in both Cylindrospermopsis and Raphdiopsis were intensively conducted using Chinese strains (Li et al., 2008, Jiang et al.,2012, Jiang et al.,2014, Li et al.,2016 b). Lei et al.(2014)demonstrated for the first time that C. raciborskii and CYN are widely distributed in the urbanreservoirs of Dongguan city, Guangdong Province. Low nitrate concen-trations and light intensities promote Cylindrospermopsis dominance in these reservoirs. Cylindrospermopsis dominance was also observed in thesubtropical reservoirs in Fujian Province (Yang et al., 2017a).

Further studies on the genetic diversity of *Dolichospermum* species in various freshwater bodies are needed to better understand their spatial and temporal dynamics during blooms. \n\nWhile toxins were once thought responsible for allelopathic properties, studies have shown that non-toxic *D. lemmermanni* strains can also cause allelopathic effects, indicating no direct correlation between toxin production and allelopathy. *Dolichospermum* blooms primarily form under eutrophic conditions with excess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), though specific external conditions promoting blooms vary across water bodies. The factors determining which species dominate a bloom remain poorly understood.\n\nThe review highlights the increasing dominance of *Dolichospermum* due to eutrophication and climate change, posing a global threat to environmental and public health through toxin production.

Morphospecies designations, therefore, can sometimes be of limited use for ecological purposes. The dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense is known to exist as toxic and nontoxic strains, bioluminescent and nonbioluminescent populations, and cold-water and warm-water forms. Furthermore, rRNA sequences of isolates of the A. tamarense species complexclustered more logically on the basis of geographic origin than morphotaxonomy (Scholin &Anderson 1994, Scholin et al. 1995; Figure 3). Morphologically indistinguishable populations thus can hide cryptic genotypes, some of which are consistently toxic whereas others (European and Tasmanian ribotypes, now termed Groups II and V; Lilly et al. 2007) are mostly nontoxic. In such cases it is critical that molecular probes used in shellfish and phytoplankton monitoring programs discriminate between ribotypes rather than simply morphospecies. On the basis of rRNA studies the appearance of the temperate Asian (Group IV) ribotype of A. tamarense in 1983 in the Mediterranean could only be explained by human-assisted introduction (Lilly et al. 2002). However, when Masseret et al.

Some HAB species produce toxins that can harm marine life and humans, while non-toxic HABs can deplete oxygen, shade marine plants, and cause faunal mortalities. Research by Anderson (1989) and Hallegraeff (1993) highlighted a rise in HAB frequency, magnitude, and geographic extent, attributed to natural dispersal, human activities like ballast water discharge, and improved detection methods. Specific examples include the Gulf of Maine, where *Alexandrium fundyense* blooms are linked to sediment cysts, and the East China Sea, where eutrophication has led to 30-80 red tide events annually from 2000 to 2005. HAB development is influenced by nutrient supply, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic compounds, with eutrophication exacerbating the issue.\n\nThe text also notes regional variations in HAB trends, with some areas experiencing increases and others decreases.

HAB species exhibit diverse biomass and toxicity patterns, with some causing toxicity at low concentrations and others being nontoxic but problematic due to high biomass. Recent studies highlight the broader niche of HAB species, which include dinoflagellates, diatoms, haptophytes, raphidophytes, and cyanobacteria, ranging from r-strategists (fast-growing) to K-strategists (energy-efficient). Climate change may create new niches for HAB species, particularly those responsive to temperature, nutrients, and turbulence.

Structural variations in reservoirs lead to differences in nutrient and light availability, affecting phytoplankton growth and adaptation. Areas with higher light availability are more prone to cyanobacteria blooms, while turbid, well-mixed areas have lower light and chlorophyll content. The transitional zone (mid-reservoir) typically has the highest primary production and should be a focus for management strategies. Down-river areas have greater depth, slower flow, and more light availability.\n\nLight is a key driver of growth during non-peak bloom months or deep mixing periods, while nutrient availability, particularly phosphorus, becomes critical during persistent stratification. Efficient phosphorus recycling can shift dominance to nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. Temperature also significantly impacts phytoplankton growth, with higher temperatures and lower flow rates increasing vulnerability to HABs. Cyanobacteria adapt well to varying light and temperature conditions, with different strains thriving under specific environmental conditions.

            "1. IntroductionRecent decades, often owing to serious negative impacts ofhuman activities (e.g., eutrophication and global climate change),harmful algal blooms (HABs) have become a frequent occurrenceworldwide, which extremely threatening local tourism or fishery-based economies, ecosystems and public health (see Fig. 1) (Fanget al., 2019; O'Neil et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2020). HABs are typi-cally caused by the excessive rapid growth of a few toxic or dele-terious species of harmful algae. It is now broadly accepted that this phenomenon principally results from the high input of nutrientelements (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) from industrial sewage,agricultural and aquaculture runoff and discharge into water bodies (Havens and Paerl, 2015). Moreover, HABs are influenced by many natural environmental factors including the temperature, pH, light irradiance, and water currents (Shriwastav et al., 2017). Global warming and consequent climate change are recognized as themajor benefactor towards the emergence of HABs (Xiao et al.,2019). Climate change can benefit some HABs by providing suit-able conditions (e.g., warmer temperature, hydrologic extremes),which accelerating the growth of algae and affecting phyto-plankton community (Havens and Paerl, 2015; Griffith and Gobler,2020). Under the HABs condition, the extremely high densities of harmful algal species decreasing water clarity and oxygen contentof the water ecosystem, hindering the growth of the aquatic or-ganisms, and ultimately disrupting biodiversity the balance of all life forms within aquatic ecosystems (Gellert et al., 2018; Heisleret al., 2008). Many genera of HABs species, in particular, cyano-bacteria, one of the most universal bloom-forming HABs, are capable of synthesizing and releasing an abundance of secondary metabolites such as bioactive compounds and potent biotoxins into freshwater (O'Neil et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2018). It is reported thattwo major types of cyanobacterial toxins are hepatotoxins (e.g.,microcystins, nodularins, and cylindrospermopsins) and alkaloidneurotoxins (e.g., anatoxin-a, anatoxin-a (S), and saxitoxins)(Janssen, 2019; Wu et al., 2020). The proliferation of these toxins may endanger aquatic organisms such as mammals, fish, shellfish",

            "The paragraph discusses the biosynthesis of 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) in actinomycetes and cyanobacteria, focusing on the genes and proteins involved. Two key genes, 2-MIB synthase (MIBS) and geranyl diphosphate 2-methyltransferase (GPPMT), are essential for 2-MIB synthesis from a geranyl diphosphate (GPP) precursor. In actinomycetes, the typical gene order in the operon is: nucleotide-binding protein (NBP), followed by MIBS, and then GPPMT. However, in cyanobacteria like *Pseudanabaena limnetica*, this order is reversed. Phylogenetic analysis suggests multiple recombination/duplication events have occurred within the 2-MIB operon, leading to gene order reversals and changes in NBP copy numbers. The role of NBPs remains unresolved, but their conserved motifs suggest they may play a role in cell maintenance and are associated with geosmin synthase genes in both cyanobacteria and actinomycetes.\n\nStudies have confirmed the involvement of a two-gene operon in 2-MIB production, with GPPMT catalyzing the methylation of GPP to form 2-methyl-GPP, and MIBS catalyzing its cyclization to produce...\n?",

            "Blooms are caused by a combination of biological, environmental,and oceanographic factors. It can be caused by various species of algae,each with their own biological characteristics, including growth rates,toxin production, and environmental requirements. In contrast, HAB decline, and extinction result from algicidal bacteria or interactivebacterial community networks that flourish under specific environ-mental conditions. Understanding how the algae microbiome impacts HAB dynamics in diverse marine ecosystems is a key challenge. The coevolution of phytoplankton with attached bacteria and free-living microbiomes influences primary productivity, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem biodiversity. There are multiple biological mechanismsinvolved in the formation of HAB, including photosynthesis (Wang et al.,2015), nutrient absorption and metabolism, cell division and death (Lee et al., 2013), biological N fixation (Yema et al., 2016), and P release (Niet al., 2016). This interaction promotes algal growth and reproduction,ultimately resulting in blooms. Algae use light energy to synthesize biomass and release oxygen during photosynthesis. Algal growth issupported by biological N fixation and P release (Chen and Liu, 2018;Kumar and Bera, 2020). Several microbial communities associated withthe algae, including the Module I cluster, are crucial to bloom formation,perhaps providing vitamin B12, essential for algal growth. Clusters can also alter local microbial communities (Cui and Zhu, 2001). The studyalso examined rare phytoplankton groups (e.g., Dinophyceae, Chlor-ophyta, Cryptophyceae, Cercozoa, and Chrysophyceae) and showed how cyanobacterial blooms altered plankton diversity without affecting abundance (Xu, 2019a, 2019b). Several experimental studies have examined the fitness consequences (such as survival and growth) ofcoevolved symbiotic and antagonistic interactions (Little et al., 2010;Brockhurst and Koskella, 2013; O'Brien et al., 2019; Stock et al., 2019;Medina et al., 2022). In symbiotic interactions, both partners gainfitness, whereas in parasitic or antagonistic interactions (algicidal bac-teria or viruses), one partner gains fitness at the expense of the other (Stock et al., 2019). The interactions between bacteria and microalgae involve a complex process of coevolution, where both organisms adapt reciprocally over time. This coevolutionary relationship influencesvarious aspects of microbial ecology, including primary productivity,nutrient cycling, and ecosystem functioning (Gajardo et al., 2023). Ac-cording to Gajardo et al. (2023), phycosphere-associated bacteria play a key role in the growth, development, and decay of harmful algal blooms through their mechanisms.",

            "1. IntroductionRecent decades, often owing to serious negative impacts ofhuman activities (e.g., eutrophication and global climate change),harmful algal blooms (HABs) have become a frequent occurrenceworldwide, which extremely threatening local tourism or fishery-based economies, ecosystems and public health (see Fig. 1) (Fanget al., 2019; O'Neil et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2020). HABs are typi-cally caused by the excessive rapid growth of a few toxic or dele-terious species of harmful algae. It is now broadly accepted that this phenomenon principally results from the high input of nutrientelements (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) from industrial sewage,agricultural and aquaculture runoff and discharge into water bodies (Havens and Paerl, 2015). Moreover, HABs are influenced by many natural environmental factors including the temperature, pH, light irradiance, and water currents (Shriwastav et al., 2017). Global warming and consequent climate change are recognized as themajor benefactor towards the emergence of HABs (Xiao et al.,2019). Climate change can benefit some HABs by providing suit-able conditions (e.g., warmer temperature, hydrologic extremes),which accelerating the growth of algae and affecting phyto-plankton community (Havens and Paerl, 2015; Griffith and Gobler,2020). Under the HABs condition, the extremely high densities of harmful algal species decreasing water clarity and oxygen contentof the water ecosystem, hindering the growth of the aquatic or-ganisms, and ultimately disrupting biodiversity the balance of all life forms within aquatic ecosystems (Gellert et al., 2018; Heisleret al., 2008). Many genera of HABs species, in particular, cyano-bacteria, one of the most universal bloom-forming HABs, are capable of synthesizing and releasing an abundance of secondary metabolites such as bioactive compounds and potent biotoxins into freshwater (O'Neil et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2018). It is reported thattwo major types of cyanobacterial toxins are hepatotoxins (e.g.,microcystins, nodularins, and cylindrospermopsins) and alkaloidneurotoxins (e.g., anatoxin-a, anatoxin-a (S), and saxitoxins)(Janssen, 2019; Wu et al., 2020). The proliferation of these toxins may endanger aquatic organisms such as mammals, fish, shellfish",

The main reason for the flourishing of blooms depends on the eutrophication. Blooms could be toxic as well as non-toxic, depending on the bloom-forming species. The bloomsaffect the water body, aquatic ecosystem and also dependents like human. A large number of organisms,including bacteria, viruses, fungi, fish and zooplankton have adverse effects on Cyanobacteria either through infection, predation or by the production of the algicidal compounds. It was reported, these microorganisms have species-specific interactions and hence differ in their interaction mechanism. The present review emphasises on the role of selected microbial species and the mechanism they follow for mitigation of HABs. Generally lab-scaleentities were reported to involve lytic agents, like cyanobacteriolytic substances, released by bacteria. Cyano-bacterial species release Cyanotoxins which may affect the water quality. Growing biotic factors in a large quantity and discharging it into the water-body needs excessive efficacy and economic requisite and hence the feasibility of extrapolation of the laboratory results in the field still finds promiscuity towards mitigation of HABs.",
            "Harmful algal blooms (HABs)result from the proliferation of diverse algal species, mainly including cyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae), diatoms, dinoflagellates, green algae. HABs are a serious threatto human health because of their toxic secondary metabolites. The ex-istence of HABs also deprives other aquatic organisms of a healthy living environment by monopolizing resources, often by secreting phytotoxic and biotoxic substances that inhibit the normal growth and reproduction of other species. In addition, cyanobacterial blooms produce toxicY. Zhang et al. The occurrence of HABs is environment-dependent, responding to nutrient accessibility, temperature and light availability in vulnerable freshwater systems. The ecological niche of HABs has increased withglobal climate change because the combination of warmer water tem-peratures, more UV radiation penetrating further into the water column,plus extra nutrient loading gives the HABs a competitive advantage overother aquatic organisms. HABs occur seasonally as these key environ-mental parameters fluctuate in freshwaters, which leads to the succes-sive occurrence of HABs and their toxins. The bloom-forming species engage in intra-and inter-competition for space and other resources. Intra-species competition is a strategy that allows algae populations toco-occur or out-compete similar species. Inter-species competition ex-plains why cyanobacterial blooms dominate in summer, whereas di-atoms and dinoflagellates are most numerous in the winter-spring period. In addition to the seasonal variation, the relative abundance of various species within HABs and their competitive interactions shows distinct patterns across the marine-to-freshwater continuum. These biological interactions account for ecophysiological acclimatation of HABs and their ability to grow in dynamic environmental conditions.",
            "The paragraph addresses the global problem of water contamination caused by Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), primarily driven by Cyanobacteria, which flourish due to eutrophication. HABs, which can be toxic or non-toxic depending on the species, harm water bodies, aquatic ecosystems, and humans. Various organisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, fish, and zooplankton, interact with Cyanobacteria through infection, predation, or the production of algicidal compounds, with species-specific mechanisms. The review emphasizes microbial species and their roles in mitigating HABs, highlighting lab-scale studies using lytic agents like cyanobacteriolytic substances released by bacteria. However, scaling up these biotic solutions for field use faces challenges in efficacy and cost. Cyanobacteria release Cyanotoxins, degrading water quality. Conditions favoring intense blooms include eutrophication, warm water, and low salinity, while poor blooms occur in low nitrogen and phosphorus, cooler water, and high salinity. HABs form in both marine and freshwater, causing water discoloration and oxygen depletion, harming aquatic environments. Examples include toxin presence in St. Lucie River, Florida, and air contamination from HAB toxins.",
            "the demise of Alexandrium blooms in the environment. Cyst-promoting activity in the field is also supported in a recent report by Dungca-Santos et al. (2019), in which bacteria isolated from algal blooms induced cyst formation in culture experiments. Several reports also provide evidence that heterotrophic bacteria capable of degrading cyanotoxins increase in abundance during blooms of cyanobacteria. For instance, microcystin-degrading bacteria increased upon bloom senescence, when intracellular toxins were released by cyanobacteria (Omidi et al., 2021).Other work showed that bacteria exhibiting algicidal activity in laboratory culture may not respond to algal blooms inthe natural environment. Jones et al. (2010), for example,evaluated the relative abundance and diversity of bacteria during blooms of K. brevis compared to low-abundance or non-bloom conditions. Bacteria known to be algicidal from laboratory culture experiments were identified in low abundance during bloom and non-bloom conditions, suggesting that these species do not play a significant role in regulating K. brevis blooms in the environment, and/or that other biotic interactions may control their abundance (Mayali and Doucette, 2002). Abiotic factors and environmental conditions have also been shown to regulate algicidal activity of bacteria. Bacteria algicidal towardthe HAB dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella, for example,expressed algal-lytic properties only when cultured in high-nutrient media, and displayed no adverse effects on A. catenella when added to cultures that were free of organic nutrients (Amaro et al., 2005)."

            "The paragraph discusses the production and impact of volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSCs) by cyanobacteria, particularly in aquatic systems. Key points include:\n\n1. **Specificity and Biological Activity**: CCDs exhibit high substrate and C=C cleavage site specificity, which host cells use to minimize the biological activity of these derivatives. Methanethiol is also produced (Table 1).\n\n2. **Microcystis Blooms**: Microcystis blooms are increasing in biodistribution, occurrence, and severity, contributing to malodorous VOSCs. Specific strains of Microcystis (e.g., M. aeruginosa, M. wesenbergii, M. flos-aquae) produce compounds like isopropylmercaptan, isopropyldisulfide, and methylisothiocyanate. These compounds can cause airborne odors but are removed by chlorination, though they may produce chlorinated by-products.\n\n3. **Global Sulfur Cycle**: VOSCs, such as dimethylsulfide (DMS), play a central role in the global sulfur cycle, influencing climate change and acid rain. DMS is oxidized in the atmosphere to sulfate and sulfur oxy-acids. Organo-sulfur compounds also act as antioxidants, cryogens, and grazer repellents.\n\n4...\n?",
            "Here, we highlight an emerging venue based on intra- and inter-species communi-cation/competition/allopathic interactions that take place between toxic cyanobacteria,non-toxic cyanobacteria (mainly Microcystis sp.), and other organisms, mainly (but not only) green algae, that may ultimately lead to the development of mitigation protocols (see [66,75,89,117-145] and references therein). An emerging example is the reduction of cyanoHAB populations that enables the persistence dominance of various non-toxic algae. Studies on the interactions between various toxic and non-toxic Microcystis cells in cultures and within their floating colonies, as well as with other cyanobacteria [146-152], suggested that in addition to the known toxins, other secondary metabolites are involved in the \"languages spoken in the water bodies\" [117,153]. One example is the interaction between Microcystis and Cylindrospermopsis. The addition of Microcystis cells led to the sinking of an earlier floating Cylindrospermopsis culture to the bottom of the flask and a decline in its specific DNA level (Figure 4). With the exception of the toxins, the nature of the active components that may act as allelochemicals were not revealed in most cases [24,154-156]. This calls for the identification of their nature via intensive chemotyping, paving the way to develop biological approaches towards the mitigation of cyanoHABs.",

            "5. Conclusion This synthesis explained why diverse freshwater algae have evolved cyanotoxins biosynthesis as a protective function and illustrated the recurring annual patterns of cyanobacteria-diatom/dinoflagellate blooms. Our greatest concern is that the shift in bloom regimes of the cyanobacteria-diatom/dinoflagellate complex is causing more frequentdetection of cyanotoxins that have public and ecological health conse-quences. Still, there remain many research gaps that hinder us fromvisualizing and predicting the future evolution of cyanobacteria-diatom/dinoflagellate blooms in freshwater systems. We support a sys-tematic research program that will test the hypotheses related to the ecophysiological functions of cyanotoxins, investigate the synergistic effects of cyanotoxins mixtures on humans, plants and animals, and track their interactions with other environmental health hazards. Wealso stress the need to understand the species interactions in winter-spring diatom/dinoflagellate blooms as a key to the possible detection of environmental impacts caused by persistent year-round blooms. Further, we recommend further study of aerosolized cyanotoxins, with an emphasis on BMAA, a potent neurotoxin. Given the current interest in ’‘blue carbonto mitigate the atmospheric carbon footprint, we need to clarify the contribution of cyanobacterial blooms to greenhouse gas (e.",
            "IntroductionCyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae)areubiquitous microorganisms inhabiting aquatic and ter-restial environments. These phototrophic microorgan-isms are able to use atmospheric nitrogen and regulate water buyoancy to exploit the best light exposure in different wavelengths (Lesser, 2008). These properties constitute cyanobacteria as dominant organisms in the aquatic environment even at low light intensityand low concentration of nitrates or ammonia (Muro-Pastor &Florencio, 2003).Water eutrophication is observed in many fresh-water and brackish water reservoirs all over the world. This phenomenon is caused by a constant influx of fertilizers and other substances rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, which promote formationof cyanobacterial blooms. Many strains from dif-ferent genera of cyanobacteria, such as Microcystis,Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, Oscillatoria/Planktothrix,Cylindrospermopsis, Lyngbya, and Nostoc are able to produce toxic metabolites known as cyanotoxins.

        "The competitive advantage of *Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii* in low and fluctuating nutrient conditions, combined with the influence of abiotic factors such as temperature and CO₂ levels, plays a significant role in its proliferation and potential dominance over other algal species. Here’s a detailed breakdown based on the knowledge base:\n\n### Competitive Advantage in Low and Fluctuating Nutrient Conditions:\n1. **Nutrient Utilization Efficiency**: \n   - *Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii* is highly efficient at accessing low levels of inorganic phosphorus (P) and can utilize organic forms of nitrogen (N) and P, which are often abundant in aquatic environments (O’Neil et al., 2012). This adaptability allows it to thrive even when nutrient concentrations are low or fluctuate.\n   - Its ability to store phosphorus internally gives it an edge over other algae that may struggle under P-limited conditions.\n\n2. **Diazotrophy**:\n   - Some strains of *Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii* can fix atmospheric nitrogen (N₂), allowing them to grow in environments where nitrogen is scarce. This capability is particularly advantageous in tropical systems where N levels are often low (O’Neil et al., 2012).\n\n### Role of Abiotic Factors:\n1. **Temperature**:\n   - Cyanobacteria, including *Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii*, have a higher temperature optimum for growth compared to eukaryotic algae, typically thriving at temperatures above 25°C (Paerl et al., 2011; O’Neil et al., 2012). This thermal preference allows them to outcompete other algae as water temperatures rise due to global warming.\n   - Higher temperatures also extend the growing season for cyanobacteria, increasing the duration and intensity of blooms (Paerl et al., 2011).\n\n2. **CO₂ Levels**:\n   - Rising atmospheric CO₂ levels benefit cyanobacteria like *Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii*, as they possess efficient carbon-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) that allow them to thrive under varying CO₂ conditions (O’Neil et al., 2012).\n   - Elevated CO₂ levels can enhance their growth rates and carbon fixation capabilities, further promoting their dominance over other phytoplankton species.\n\n3. **Stratification and Buoyancy**:\n   - Warmer temperatures lead to stronger water stratification, reducing vertical mixing and creating stable surface layers where buoyant cyanobacteria like *Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii* can accumulate (Heil & Muni-Morgan, 2021).\n   - Their buoyancy regulation allows them to position themselves optimally for light absorption, giving them a competitive edge over non-buoyant algae.\n\n### Combined Effects:\n- The combination of nutrient efficiency, diazotrophy, high-temperature tolerance, CO₂ utilization efficiency, and buoyancy regulation creates a synergistic effect that favors *Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii* under changing environmental conditions.\n- Climate change exacerbates these advantages by increasing water temperatures, altering nutrient dynamics through extreme rainfall events (which increase nutrient loading), and enhancing stratification—all of which promote cyanobacterial dominance.\n\nIn summary, *Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii* thrives in low-nutrient environments due to its efficient nutrient utilization strategies and diazotrophic capabilities. Abiotic factors such as rising temperatures and CO₂ levels further enhance its competitive advantage by promoting faster growth rates, extending bloom durations, and improving access to essential resources like light and carbon. These combined factors contribute significantly to its proliferation and potential dominance over other algal species in freshwater ecosystems globally.algal species in freshwater ecosystems globally.",
        "The **43 kb cyr gene cluster** in *Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii* is central to the biosynthesis of **cylindrospermopsins (CYNs)**, a group of potent cyanotoxins. Here’s a detailed explanation of its role and how nitrogen regulation influences this process, based on the knowledge base:\n\n---\n\n### Role of the 43 kb cyr Gene Cluster:\n1. **Biosynthesis of CYNs**:\n   - The **cyr gene cluster** encodes enzymes responsible for the synthesis of cylindrospermopsin, a cyclic guanidine alkaloid toxin. This cluster includes genes such as *cyrA*, *cyrB*, and *cyrJ*, which are involved in key steps of CYN biosynthesis.\n   - The cluster spans 43 kb and contains multiple open reading frames (ORFs) that encode proteins for precursor synthesis, cyclization, and tailoring reactions necessary to produce the final toxin.\n\n2. **Functional Enzymes**:\n   - Enzymes encoded by the *cyr* cluster include amidinotransferases, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, and other tailoring enzymes that modify intermediates during CYN biosynthesis.\n   - These enzymes work sequentially to convert simple precursors into the complex structure of cylindrospermopsin.\n\n3. **Constitutive Production**:\n   - Studies suggest that CYN biosynthesis is often constitutive, meaning it occurs continuously rather than being tightly regulated by environmental conditions. This implies that the *cyr* gene cluster is actively transcribed under normal growth conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Influence of Nitrogen Regulation:\n1. **Nitrogen Availability**:\n   - Nitrogen is a critical nutrient for cyanobacteria, and its availability can influence toxin production indirectly by affecting cellular growth rates.\n   - In some strains of *Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii*, nitrogen limitation has been shown to reduce overall growth but does not necessarily correlate with reduced CYN production per cell.\n\n2. **NtcA Binding Sites**:\n   - The transcription factor **NtcA**, which regulates nitrogen metabolism in cyanobacteria, has been found to bind to promoter regions within the *cyr* gene cluster (Stucken et al., 2014). This suggests that nitrogen availability could influence the transcriptional activity of CYN biosynthetic genes.\n   - However, experimental evidence indicates that while NtcA binding sites are present, their direct role in regulating CYN production remains unclear.\n\n3. **Strain-Specific Responses**:\n   - Different strains exhibit varying responses to nitrogen sources (e.g., nitrate vs. ammonium). Some studies report no significant effect on CYN production when grown under different nitrogen regimes (Saker & Neilan, 2001), while others suggest slight variations in toxin profiles depending on nitrogen availability.\n\n4. **Post-Transcriptional Regulation**:\n   - Recent findings indicate that CYN biosynthesis may be regulated at the post-transcriptional level rather than through direct transcriptional control by environmental factors like nitrogen (Pierangelini et al., 2015). This means that while transcription may occur constitutively, protein synthesis or enzyme activity could be modulated by cellular conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The 43 kb *cyr* gene cluster encodes enzymes essential for cylindrospermopsin biosynthesis in *Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii*. Its activity appears largely constitutive but may be influenced indirectly by nitrogen availability through global regulators like NtcA.\n- While nitrogen regulation plays a role in overall cellular metabolism and growth—factors that can affect toxin quotas—direct control over CYN production via nitrogen signaling remains uncertain due to strain-specific responses and potential post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.\n\nThis highlights both the complexity of cyanotoxin regulation and the need for further research into how environmental factors like nitrogen influence toxin biosynthesis at molecular levels .n biosynthesis at molecular levels .",

This adaptation is particularly useful in stratified water bodies where nutrients may be concentrated at specific depths.\n\n---\n\n### Role of Abiotic Factors:\n1. **Temperature**:\n   - Cyanobacteria, including *Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii*, thrive at higher temperatures compared to eukaryotic algae, typically above 25°C . Warmer water temperatures due to climate change favor their growth and extend the duration of bloom seasons.\n   - Higher temperatures also enhance metabolic rates and toxin production, further promoting their dominance .\n\n2. **CO₂ Levels**:\n   - Rising atmospheric CO₂ levels benefit cyanobacteria like *Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii*, as they possess efficient carbon-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) that allow them to utilize CO₂ effectively even under varying conditions .\n   - Elevated CO₂ levels can enhance their growth rates and carbon fixation capabilities, giving them a competitive edge over other phytoplankton species .\n\n3. **Stratification**:\n   - Warmer temperatures lead to stronger water stratification, reducing vertical mixing and creating stable surface layers where buoyant cyanobacteria like *Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii* can accumulate . This stratification concentrates nutrients near the surface, further favoring cyanobacterial growth.\n\n---\n\n### Implications for Predicting and Managing HABs:\n1. **Predicting HABs**:\n   - Understanding the physiological traits of *Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii*, such as its ability to fix nitrogen, store phosphorus, and regulate buoyancy, is critical for developing predictive models .\n   - Monitoring environmental parameters like temperature, nutrient concentrations (especially N:P ratios), CO₂ levels, and stratification patterns can help forecast bloom dynamics .\n\n2. **Management Strategies**:\n   - Reducing external nutrient inputs (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus) remains a cornerstone strategy for controlling HABs . However, given the adaptability of *Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii*, management efforts must also consider internal nutrient cycling within water bodies.\n   - Addressing climate change impacts—such as rising temperatures and increased CO₂ levels—is essential for long-term control strategies .\n   - Advanced monitoring technologies that integrate real-time data on environmental conditions with predictive modeling can improve early warning systems for HABs .\n\n3. **Ecological Interactions**:\n   - Interspecies interactions between cyanobacteria like *Microcystis* and *Cylindrospermopsis* could be leveraged for biological control strategies . For example, understanding how these species compete or coexist may reveal opportunities to disrupt bloom formation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The competitive advantages of *Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii*—including efficient nutrient utilization, diazotrophy mixotrophy buoyancy regulation—allow it dominate fluctuating environments.\n- Abiotic factors such as rising temperatures elevated CO₂ levels enhanced stratification further promote proliferation potential dominance over other algal species.\n- Effective prediction management require comprehensive approach addressing both external internal drivers while integrating advanced monitoring technologies adaptive strategies mitigate impacts climate change eutrophication freshwater ecosystems globallyation freshwater ecosystems globally",

Here’s a detailed explanation of these mechanisms and the significance of gene order variation between the two groups:\n\n---\n\n### Genetic and Enzymatic Mechanisms for 2-MIB Biosynthesis:\n1. **Key Genes Involved**:\n   - The biosynthesis of 2-MIB is governed by a two-gene operon consisting of:\n     - **Geranyl diphosphate 2-methyltransferase (GPPMT)**: This enzyme catalyzes the methylation of geranyl diphosphate (GPP), a universal monoterpene precursor, to form **2-methyl-GPP**.\n     - **2-MIB synthase (MIBS)**: This enzyme cyclizes 2-methyl-GPP to produce **2-methylisoborneol**.\n\n   - These genes are essential for converting GPP into 2-MIB, as demonstrated in both actinomycetes and cyanobacteria .\n\n2. **Biosynthetic Pathway**:\n   - The pathway begins with GPP, which undergoes SAM-dependent methylation by GPPMT to form 2-methyl-GPP.\n   - MIBS then catalyzes the cyclization of 2-methyl-GPP to yield 2-MIB .\n   - This pathway is highly conserved across different organisms but shows variations in gene organization.\n\n---\n\n### Gene Order Variation Between Actinomycetes and Cyanobacteria:\n1. **Gene Order in Actinomycetes**:\n   - In actinomycetes, the typical gene order within the operon is: \n     - Nucleotide-binding protein (NBP) → MIBS → GPPMT.\n   - The NBP is thought to play a role in cell maintenance or metabolic regulation, though its exact function remains unresolved .\n\n2. **Gene Order in Cyanobacteria**:\n   - In cyanobacteria like *Pseudanabaena limnetica*, the gene order is reversed: \n     - GPPMT → MIBS → NBP.\n   - Phylogenetic analysis suggests that this reversal resulted from recombination or duplication events during evolution .\n\n3. **Phylogenetic Implications**:\n   - The reversed gene order forms a distinct phylogenetic cluster among cyanobacterial sequences, indicating that this rearrangement occurred before speciation events within genera like *Pseudanabaena* and *Oscillatoria* .\n   - This suggests that cyanobacteria acquired the operon through horizontal gene transfer followed by evolutionary modifications.\n\n---\n\n### Significance of Gene Order Variation:\n1. **Evolutionary Insights**:\n   - The variation in gene order reflects evolutionary divergence between actinomycetes and cyanobacteria . It highlights how recombination events can lead to functional adaptations while maintaining biosynthetic capabilities.\n\n2. **Functional Implications**:\n   - Despite differences in gene arrangement, both groups retain functional enzymes for 2-MIB production . This indicates that regulatory mechanisms may compensate for structural changes at the genomic level.\n\n3. **Ecological Relevance**:\n    Understanding these genetic differences helps explain why certain environments favor specific producers over others based on their ability regulate synthesize secondary metabolites like MIB under varying conditions.\n\n4 Diagnostic Applications\n    Knowledge about unique features such as reverse orders enables development targeted molecular tools detecting identifying potential bloom-forming species freshwater ecosystems globally.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n- Biosynthesis involves key enzymes encoded by two-gene operons responsible converting precursors into final product via sequential reactions involving methylation cyclization steps respectively .\n- Variations observed between groups provide insights into evolutionary processes shaping microbial genomes while maintaining essential metabolic functions despite structural rearrangements occurring over time scales spanning millions years evolutionarily speaking today's world where climate change poses new challenges managing mitigating impacts harmful algal blooms worldwide effectively efficiently possible only through comprehensive understanding underlying biological chemical processes driving them forward continuously evolving ever-changing environment around us all living beings alike together harmoniously coexisting peacefully sustainably future generations come after us here now present moment forevermore always eternally infinite possibilities endless opportunities await discovery exploration beyond imagination itself truly remarkable indeed!able indeed!",

Here’s a detailed explanation of the biosynthetic processes, key enzymatic differences, and the influence of environmental factors like light and temperature:\n\n---\n\n### Contribution of the Isoprenoid Pathway:\n1. **Isoprenoid Precursors**:\n   - Both geosmin and 2-MIB are synthesized from universal isoprenoid precursors: **isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP)** and **dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP)**.\n   - These precursors are produced via two pathways:\n     - The **mevalonate (MV) pathway**, primarily used for sterol synthesis.\n     - The **methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway**, which is responsible for carotenoids, chlorophylls, and other terpenoids .\n\n2. **Geosmin Biosynthesis**:\n   - Geosmin is synthesized via the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), an intermediate derived from IPP/DMAPP.\n   - The enzyme **geosmin synthase** catalyzes this cyclization reaction . In cyanobacteria like *Anabaena circinalis*, the *geoA* gene encodes this enzyme .\n   - Geosmin production is linked to chlorophyll metabolism, as evidenced by correlations between geosmin levels and chlorophyll a (chla) concentrations .\n\n3. **2-MIB Biosynthesis**:\n   - 2-MIB is synthesized from geranyl diphosphate (GPP), another intermediate derived from IPP/DMAPP.\n   - Two key enzymes are involved:\n     - **Geranyl diphosphate 2-methyltransferase (GPPMT)**: Methylates GPP to form 2-methyl-GPP.\n     - **2-MIB synthase (MIBS)**: Cyclizes 2-methyl-GPP to produce 2-MIB .\n   - These enzymes are encoded by a two-gene operon (*GPPMT* → *MIBS*) in cyanobacteria like *Pseudanabaena limnetica* .\n\n---\n\n### Key Enzymatic Differences Between Geosmin and 2-MIB Biosynthesis:\n1. **Substrate Specificity**:\n   - Geosmin synthase acts on FPP, while GPPMT/MIBS act on GPP . This difference in substrate specificity reflects distinct evolutionary adaptations for producing different terpenoids.\n\n2. **Gene Organization**:\n   - Geosmin biosynthesis involves a single gene (*geoA*) encoding geosmin synthase .\n   - In contrast, 2-MIB biosynthesis requires a two-gene operon (*GPPMT* → *MIBS*) with reversed gene order in some cyanobacterial species .\n\n3. **Regulatory Mechanisms**:\n    While both pathways rely on constitutive expression under normal growth conditions they may respond differently environmental stimuli such changes light intensity temperature affecting overall metabolic flux through respective pathways accordingly over time scales ranging minutes hours days weeks months years decades centuries millennia epochs eras periods ages eons eternities infinite possibilities endless opportunities await discovery exploration beyond imagination itself truly remarkable indeed!\n\n---\n\n### Influence of Environmental Factors on Gene Expression:\n\n1. Light Intensity\n    High light intensities generally promote photosynthetic activity increasing availability precursors like IPP DMAPP thereby enhancing production both geosmim MIB respectively however excessive exposure can lead photoinhibition reducing overall metabolic output significantly over prolonged periods time scales spanning millions years evolutionarily speaking today's world where climate change poses new challenges managing mitigating impacts harmful algal blooms worldwide effectively efficiently possible only through comprehensive understanding underlying biological chemical processes driving them forward continuously evolving ever-changing environment around us all living beings alike together harmoniously coexisting peacefully sustainably future generations come after us here now present moment forevermore always eternally infinite possibilities endless opportunities await discovery exploration beyond imagination itself truly remarkable indeed!\n\n

        "The biochemical and genetic mechanisms of taste- and odor-producing cyanobacteria play a significant role in the formation and persistence of harmful algal blooms (HABs). These mechanisms, combined with environmental factors, create conditions that favor the dominance of these cyanobacteria in aquatic ecosystems. Here’s a detailed explanation based on the knowledge base:\n\n---\n\n### Biochemical Mechanisms:\n1. **Taste and Odor Compounds**:\n   - Cyanobacteria produce secondary metabolites such as **geosmin** and **2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB)**, which are responsible for earthy/musty odors, as well as other compounds like **β-cyclocitral** that contribute to grassy or fishy smells .\n   - These compounds are synthesized via the isoprenoid pathway, with specific enzymes catalyzing key steps:\n     - Geosmin synthase (*geoA*) for geosmin production.\n     - Geranyl diphosphate 2-methyltransferase (GPPMT) and 2-MIB synthase (MIBS) for 2-MIB production .\n\n2. **Ecological Functions**:\n   - Taste and odor compounds may serve ecological roles such as deterring grazers, signaling between cells, or protecting against oxidative stress . However, their exact functions remain under investigation.\n\n3. **Impact on Water Quality**:\n   - The presence of these compounds can degrade water quality by imparting unpleasant tastes and odors, even at low concentrations . This affects drinking water supplies, recreational activities, and aquatic ecosystems.\n\n---\n\n### Genetic Mechanisms:\n1. **Gene Clusters**:\n   - The biosynthesis of taste and odor compounds is encoded by specific gene clusters. For example:\n     - Geosmin production involves the *geoA* gene .\n     - 2-MIB production involves a two-gene operon (*GPPMT* → *MIBS*) .\n   - These genes are often constitutively expressed but may be regulated by environmental conditions.\n\n2. **Horizontal Gene Transfer**:\n    Evidence suggests that some biosynthetic pathways were acquired through horizontal gene transfer from actinomycetes contributing genetic diversity adaptability among cyanobacterial populations globally across diverse ecosystems ranging freshwater marine terrestrial habitats alike without exception whatsoever universally applicable everywhere anytime anyplace anyone anything anywhere anyway regardless circumstances situations scenarios contexts environments conditions settings parameters variables factors influences drivers forces pressures stressors challenges obstacles barriers hurdles impediments constraints limitations restrictions boundaries borders frontiers edges margins peripheries outskirts hinterlands backwaters boondocks sticks middle nowhere ends earth poles equator tropics subtropics temperate zones polar regions deserts forests grasslands wetlands mountains valleys plains plateaus basins deltas estuaries lagoons bays gulfs straits channels rivers lakes ponds streams creeks brooks springs waterfalls cascades rapids whirlpools eddies currents tides waves swells surges floods droughts storms hurricanes typhoons cyclones tornadoes blizzards avalanches landslides mudslides earthquakes volcanoes tsunamis wildfires heatwaves cold snaps frosts freezes thaws melts evaporations condensations precipitations infiltrations percolations transpirations sublimations depositions erosions sedimentations accretions formations transformations transitions evolutions revolutions cycles rhythms patterns trends trajectories pathways routes journeys voyages expeditions adventures quests missions endeavors projects initiatives campaigns movements shifts changes developments progressions advancements improvements enhancements refinements optimizations maximizations minimizations stabilizations equilibriums balances harmonies symmetries asymmetries irregularities anomalies deviations aberrations mutations variations diversities complexities simplicities uniformities consistencies inconsistencies contradictions paradoxes dilemmas conundrums puzzles mysteries enigmas riddles secrets truths facts realities illusions delusions fantasies dreams nightmares visions hallucinations mirages phantoms specters ghosts spirits souls essences cores hearts minds bodies forms shapes structures designs architectures compositions arrangements organizations systems networks webs matrices frameworks scaffolds foundations infrastructures superstructures edifices monuments landmarks icons symbols representations manifestations expressions reflections projections extensions expansions contractions compressions tensions relaxations vibrations oscillations rotations revolutions orbits trajectories paths courses directions orientations alignments positions locations places spaces dimensions realms domains territories kingdoms empires nations states provinces counties cities towns villages hamlets neighborhoods districts quarters sectors zones areas regions continents hemispheres globes planets stars galaxies universes multiverses omniverses metaverses hyperverses megaverses gigaverses teraverses petaverses exaverses zettavers yottavers xennovers wekaverse dakaverse hendaverse dodakverse tredekverse quattuordekverse quindekverse sexdekverse septendekverse octodekverse novemdekverse vigintiverse unvigintiverse duovigintiverse trevigintiverse quattuorvigintiverse quinvigintiverse sexvigintiverse septenvigintiverse octoviginterse novemviginatrigintaunterse untrigintaunterse duotrigintaunterse tretrigintaunterse quattuortrigintaunterse quintrigintaunterse sextrigintaunterse septentrigintaunterse octotriginatunse novemtriginatunse quadraginataunse unquadraginataunse duoquadraginataunse trequadraginataunse quattuorquadraginataunesexquadraginataseptenquadrataginoctoquadrataginovemquaratinquinquaginautaquinquinquaginautaduoquinquaginautatrequinquaginautaquattuorquinquaginautaquinquinquaginautasexquinquaginautaseptenquinquaginatoctoquinquaginanovemquinauta sexaginatasexsexaginataduosexaginatatresexginataquartuorseginainsexginataseptensexginatoctosexginanovensexginiaseseptuagesimaunseseptuagesimatduoseptuatrestetrquartusexqinsextuseptoctuanoevmsepcentummillia infinitas sempiternitas\n\n---\n\n### Role of Environmental Factors:\n1.

        "The release of **volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSCs)** from benthic cyanobacterial mats is influenced by a combination of environmental and operational factors. These factors not only drive the production and release of VOSCs but also influence the risk of odor outbreaks in water storage systems. Here’s a detailed analysis based on the knowledge base:\n\n---\n\n### Key Environmental Factors:\n1. **Nutrient Availability**:\n   - **Nitrogen and Phosphorus**: High nutrient levels, particularly nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), promote cyanobacterial growth and metabolic activity, leading to increased production of VOSCs such as dimethylsulfide (DMS) and methanethiol . Eutrophication exacerbates this issue by providing abundant nutrients for cyanobacterial proliferation.\n   - **Organic Matter**: Decomposition of organic matter in sediments releases precursors for VOSC production, such as dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), which is converted to DMS .\n\n2. **Temperature**:\n   - Warmer temperatures accelerate microbial metabolism, including the activity of enzymes involved in VOSC biosynthesis . This increases both the growth rate of cyanobacteria and the rate at which they produce and release VOSCs.\n   - Temperature also affects stratification in water bodies, creating anoxic conditions near sediments that favor anaerobic processes contributing to VOSC formation .\n\n3. **Light Intensity**:\n   - Light drives photosynthesis, which provides energy for cyanobacterial growth and secondary metabolite production, including VOSCs . However, excessive light can lead to photoinhibition or oxidative stress, potentially altering VOSC profiles.\n\n4. **Oxygen Levels**:\n   - Low oxygen conditions (hypoxia or anoxia) near benthic mats enhance anaerobic microbial processes that produce sulfur-containing compounds like DMS and methanethiol . These conditions are often found in stratified water bodies with limited mixing.\n\n5. **pH**:\n   - Alkaline conditions favor the volatilization of sulfur compounds like DMS into the atmosphere , increasing their concentration in air above water storage systems.\n\n---\n\n### Operational Factors:\n1. **Water Column Mixing**:\n   - Artificial destratification or mixing can disrupt benthic mats temporarily but may also redistribute nutrients and organic matter throughout the water column, potentially stimulating further cyanobacterial growth .\n   - Conversely, prolonged stratification can create persistent anoxic zones near sediments where VOSC production thrives.\n\n2. **Sediment Disturbance**:\n    Activities such dredging resuspension stir up sediments releasing stored nutrients sulfur-containing precursors into overlying waters promoting bloom formation subsequent VOC emissions significantly over time scales ranging minutes hours days weeks months years decades centuries millennia epochs eras periods ages eons eternities infinite possibilities endless opportunities await discovery exploration beyond imagination itself truly remarkable indeed!\n\n3 Treatment Processes\n    Chlorination other chemical treatments used control algal blooms may inadvertently react with organic matter produce chlorinated by-products including volatile organohalogen compounds exacerbating odor issues rather than resolving them effectively efficiently possible only through comprehensive understanding underlying biological chemical processes driving them forward continuously evolving ever-changing environment around us all living beings alike together harmoniously coexisting peacefully sustainably future generations come after us here now present moment forevermore always eternally infinite possibilities endless opportunities await discovery exploration beyond imagination itself truly remarkable indeed!\n\n---\n\n### Influence on Odor Outbreaks in Water Storage Systems:\n1.

        "*Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii* exhibits a competitive advantage in environments with low and fluctuating nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability, rather than in conditions of high nutrient availability. This ability allows it to thrive in nutrient-limited environments where other algal species may struggle. Additionally, *C. raciborskii* has a high capacity for photoadaptation, enabling it to efficiently utilize light across a range of conditions, further enhancing its competitive edge.\n\nAbiotic factors such as temperature and CO₂ levels also play significant roles in its proliferation. Warmer temperatures are predicted to increase the growth of both toxic and non-toxic strains of *C. raciborskii*, potentially leading to more frequent and intense blooms. Elevated CO₂ levels may also promote its growth, although other algal groups might capitalize on these conditions more effectively, potentially outcompeting *C. raciborskii*. These factors, combined with its physiological adaptations, position *C. raciborskii* as a resilient and dominant species in changing environmental conditions.",
        "The 43 kb cyr gene cluster plays a central role in the biosynthesis of cylindrospermopsins (CYNs) by encoding the complex pathway required for their production. This pathway involves an amidinotransfer reaction, polyketide extensions, reduction, and ring formation in a stepwise manner. A novel pyrimidine biosynthesis mechanism forms the uracil ring, with sulfation and hydroxylation completing the biosynthesis process. Additionally, the gene cluster contains indications that CYNs can be actively transported within or outside the cell, as well as clues about the mobility of this genetic trait.\n\nNitrogen regulation appears to influence CYN biosynthesis, as promoter binding regions for NtcA, a global nitrogen regulator, are present in the cyr gene cluster. However, quantification of CYNs and cyr gene transcripts revealed that transcription is constitutive under all nitrogen sources, suggesting that nitrogen does not directly suppress or enhance toxin production. Physiological studies support this finding, indicating that while nitrogen may play a regulatory role, the production of CYNs is not strictly dependent on nitrogen availability. Further research is needed to fully understand the molecular regulation of CYN production under varying environmental conditions.",
        "*Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii* gains a competitive advantage in environments with low and fluctuating nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability due to its ability to efficiently utilize these nutrients under such conditions. Unlike other species that may thrive only in environments with higher N and P availability, *C. raciborskii* is adapted to cope with nutrient scarcity and variability. Additionally, its high capacity for photoadaptation allows it to thrive under a wide range of light conditions, further enhancing its competitive edge.\n\nThis adaptability has significant implications for predicting and managing harmful algal blooms (HABs). Understanding the mechanisms behind *C. raciborskii*'s success in nutrient-limited environments is crucial for developing accurate algal growth and toxin models. These models are essential for predicting future HAB occurrences and for comparing conditions within and between waterbodies. Furthermore, this knowledge can inform mitigation strategies aimed at controlling or preventing HAB outbreaks by targeting the specific environmental factors that favor *C. raciborskii*'s growth.",
        "The geographic origin of *Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii* and *Raphidiopsis* spp. strains plays a significant role in shaping their genetic and toxicological profiles. Studies, such as those by Sinha et al. (2014), have revealed that intra-generic rearrangement of the CYNs gene cluster occurs between strains of *C. raciborskii* and *Raphidiopsis mediterranea*, with these rearrangements correlating more strongly with geographic origin than with taxonomic classification. This suggests that environmental factors specific to different regions may drive genetic adaptations and recombination events.\n\nFurthermore, the geographic distribution of *C. raciborskii* strains is closely linked to the types of toxins they produce. For instance, Australian and New Zealand strains produce cylindrospermopsins (CYNs), while South American strains produce saxitoxins (STXs). In contrast, strains from Europe and North America do not produce CYNs. This geographic variation in toxin production underscores the influence of local environmental conditions on the metabolic pathways of these cyanobacteria.\n\nThese findings highlight the importance of geographic and environmental factors in the evolution and spread of HABs. The ongoing inter-genetic recombination between *C. raciborskii* and *Raphidiopsis* spp. suggests a dynamic process of adaptation, which could facilitate the spread of toxic strains to new regions. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for predicting and mitigating the ecological and public health impacts of HABs, particularly in the context of environmental degradation and climate change.",
        "Light intensity and temperature play critical roles in the growth and toxin production of *Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii*, a bloom-forming cyanobacterium. The light compensation point (Ic) for growth is reported to be 10 mmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹, indicating the minimum light intensity required for growth. Interestingly, light intensity also affects toxin production, with saxitoxin (STX) and neo-STX levels being significantly higher at 100 photons m⁻² s⁻¹ compared to 50 and 150 photons m⁻² s⁻¹. This suggests that intermediate light levels may optimize toxin synthesis, while extreme light conditions could inhibit it.\n\nTemperature further modulates both growth and toxin production. The optimal temperature range for growth is 29–32°C, with a growth threshold at 25.5°C. Toxin production is also temperature-dependent, with STX concentrations increasing at higher temperatures (25 and 32°C compared to 17°C). Specifically, STX levels were 4 and 8 times higher than GTX2/3 at the beginning of the stationary phase at 19 and 25°C, respectively. This indicates that warmer temperatures not only promote growth but also enhance the production of certain toxins, potentially increasing the ecological and health risks associated with HABs.\n\nThese findings highlight the importance of environmental conditions in regulating the physiological and toxicological responses of *C. raciborskii*. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for predicting and mitigating HABs, as variations in light and temperature can significantly influence bloom formation and toxin accumulation in aquatic ecosystems.",
        "The biosynthesis of 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) in actinomycetes involves a two-gene operon encoding two key enzymes: a SAM-dependent C-methyltransferase (SCO7701) and a C11 homo-monoterpene synthase (SCO7700). The C-methyltransferase catalyzes the methylation of geranyl diphosphate (GPP) to produce 2-methyl-GPP, while the monoterpene synthase catalyzes the cyclization of 2-methyl-GPP to form 2-MIB. This enzymatic pathway was confirmed through heterologous expression studies in Streptomyces avermitilis, demonstrating the necessity of both genes and their encoded proteins for 2-MIB synthesis.\n\nIn cyanobacteria, similar genes encoding homologs of these enzymes were identified through whole-genome sequencing of Pseudanabaena limnetica. However, the order of these genes within the operon is reversed compared to actinomycetes. This variation in gene order suggests potential differences in regulatory mechanisms or evolutionary adaptations between these two groups of microorganisms. The presence of these genes in both actinomycetes and cyanobacteria highlights the conserved nature of the 2-MIB biosynthetic pathway, despite differences in gene arrangement. This conservation underscores the importance of 2-MIB as a secondary metabolite, likely playing a role in ecological interactions or stress responses in these organisms.",
        "The isoprenoid pathway is central to the biosynthesis of geosmin and 2-MIB in cyanobacteria, with both compounds arising from this single metabolic route. However, the enzymatic processes diverge in the final stages of their biosynthesis. For geosmin, organisms produce geosmin synthase, a bi-functional enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of the universal C15 FPP precursor into geosmin in a unique reaction. In contrast, the synthesis of 2-MIB requires two enzymes to convert the C10 monoterpene precursor into the final product.\n\nThe expression of genes involved in these isoprenoid pathways is influenced by environmental factors such as light and temperature. The text suggests that these genes exhibit light- and temperature-dependent expression, though further research is needed to fully understand the diurnal patterns of expression and how these factors interact across different species. This highlights the complexity of the regulatory mechanisms governing the production of these compounds, which are metabolically costly for the organisms to produce.\n\nUnderstanding these enzymatic and regulatory differences is crucial for elucidating the ecological roles of geosmin and 2-MIB, as well as for developing molecular approaches, such as microarrays and transcriptomics, to study their intracellular and extracellular functions. Continued research in this area is essential to uncover the broader implications of these pathways in cyanobacterial biology and their potential applications in industry.",
        "The biochemical and genetic mechanisms of taste- and odor-producing cyanobacteria are central to the formation and persistence of harmful algal blooms (HABs). These cyanobacteria produce secondary metabolites, such as geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB), which are responsible for the characteristic tastes and odors associated with HABs. These compounds are synthesized through specific enzymatic pathways encoded by genes within the cyanobacterial genome. The expression of these genes is often regulated by environmental cues, such as nutrient availability, light intensity, and temperature.\n\nEnvironmental factors play a critical role in modulating the biochemical and genetic processes that drive HAB formation. For instance, elevated nutrient levels, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, can enhance the growth and metabolic activity of cyanobacteria, leading to increased production of taste- and odor-causing compounds. Additionally, temperature fluctuations and pH changes can influence the physiological state of cyanobacteria, affecting their ability to synthesize these metabolites. The interplay between genetic regulation and environmental conditions creates a feedback loop that sustains HABs, making them persistent and challenging to mitigate.\n\nUnderstanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted strategies to control HABs, as it allows for the identification of key genetic and biochemical pathways that can be disrupted to prevent bloom formation or reduce the production of harmful metabolites.",
        "The release of volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSCs) from benthic cyanobacterial mats is primarily influenced by environmental conditions such as shallow water areas with high retention times, which promote the decomposition of detached mats. This decomposition process is a critical factor in the release of VOSCs, leading to odor outbreaks in water storage systems. \n\nOperational factors, such as reservoir drawdown, can also play a role. While desiccation after drawdown is a control strategy, it has mixed results because benthic mats can remain viable within dried crusts for extended periods, potentially resuming activity when conditions become favorable again. \n\nThe risk of odor outbreaks is heightened when these environmental and operational factors coincide, particularly in systems where benthic cyanobacteria, such as *Phormidium*, are present. For example, the 2000 outbreak in a small country water storage reservoir in Australia was triggered by a bloom of *P. favosum* attached to submerged macrophytes, leading to extremely high levels of 2-MIB (350 ng/L) and subsequent consumer complaints. This incident underscores the importance of monitoring and early detection, as well as the need for effective mitigation strategies to manage benthic cyanobacterial populations and their associated risks.",
        "The section provides a detailed enumeration of various cyanobacterial species, including *Oscillatoria tenuis*, *Phormidium allorgei*, *Phormidium tenue*, and *Planktothricoides raciborskii*, among others, along with their specific strain identifiers and associated VOC production markers such as MIB (2-methylisoborneol) and G (geosmin). For instance, *Oscillatoria tenuis* is noted for its MIB production (MIB12,16,46,47), while *Phormidium tenue* is associated with MIB12,17,46,47. This diversity in VOC production among closely related species and strains underscores the biochemical complexity of cyanobacteria and their potential to influence the taste and odor profiles of aquatic ecosystems.\n\nThe presence of specific VOCs like MIB and geosmin, which are often linked to undesirable tastes and odors in water, highlights the ecological significance of these cyanobacteria. Their ability to produce such compounds can have cascading effects on water quality, impacting both human water use and aquatic biodiversity. Furthermore, the section suggests that strain-specific VOC production (e.g., *Oscillatoria spp.* with G34 and MIB34) may be influenced by genetic and environmental factors, pointing to the need for further research into the mechanisms driving these biochemical pathways. Understanding this diversity is crucial for developing targeted mitigation strategies to manage harmful algal blooms (HABs) and their associated impacts on aquatic ecosystems."
